Mfine,Valar Dohaeris,"Truly the worst healthcare app that I've come across. After payment when invoice is generated, they don't even mention doctor's name on the receipt. There's no way to prove if prescription belongs to the said paid invoice or not. One cannot claim for reimbursement owing to this stupid policy. Literally no connection between doctor's prescription & invoice. When raised complaints, they don't help saying it's computerized. Otherwise unnecessarily calls. Cannot place medicine orders, No substitutes",1,03-06-2023 03:53

Mfine,chandra sekhar,For online consultation the app is fine but not for medicine order. I have placed an order and waited for 5 days before cancelling. Being in Bangalore city and taking more than 5 days for medicine delivery doesn't make any sense. They'll mention it'll be delivered in a day but it'll never be delivered. For medicine order better to use pharma easy and other apps.

Mfine,Swapnil Gautam,Very poor attitude of doctors. Firstly they're not on time. Then they don't even attend you properly. They don't even fully listen. They have this process. You pay them ‚Çπ500 -‚Çπ3500 and they just listen to you for first 15 seconds. Take advantage of your politeness and then disconnect the call within 2 minutes and write you prescription. Easy money for them. There should be a rule that only customer can disconnect within 5 minutes of call or they won't get paid .Mfine should implement this rule.,1,01-04-2023 08:10

After completion of the course when I get back for recheckup mfine shows your case has been closed for rechekup I have to pay again.

He collected small amount of urine i.e. 2 teaspoons was collected for test and when i raised issues for small quantity, he said our container don't leak. Other lab's collect sufficient amount of urine",1,12-01-2022 14:00

If you are having a RTPCR test from this app and waiting for results in 24 hours hours you are not getting it. I missed my 64000 ‚Çπ flight because their agent keeps lying about report. Its been more than 32 hours and I still have not received my result yet,1,04-12-2021 10:52

Mfine,Bhavika Shah,My comments are getting deleted. Its purely scam. Laboratories are not using proper caliberations. Also all their reports are showing such wrong values. I had to get everything retested at near by Lab. I urge use your regular labs rather such aggregators who dont have any clue on what kind of ref. Value to be used. For my 9 years son all values came so high that we had to rush to doc. Though the values were completely wrong.,1,04-12-2021 08:49

Have complained 5 times to MFine and every time was told that reports will be shared soon. On 7th Sept I raised the complaint again and now they are saying that would refund urine sample test amount. The issue is not money but the business ethics that are completely shaky of MFine. For seven days i kept waiting for right report for my ailing mother and this unprofessional response I received.

Medicines : App shows COD as an option, but somebody from Mfine will call you and force you to pay before delivery and still you receive wrong medicines. Uninstalling!!",1,30-05-2021 05:01

Now the blood sample was taken and I should get 16 page report with all those tests mentioned in Advanced Full Body Checkup, but only 7 pager document with irregular results. I cannot call them, request call back doesn't work and you are screwed. Because the reports are something which needs to be shown to a doctor, so appointment is cancelled. So this is very bad, I am trying to follow them and they do not have any answers. Better to go for other websites(1MG/Practo) or use the doctor suggested labs for faster results.

Mfine,Praveen Kumar,"No option to export reports? Our health records are a matter of our privacy and we have all the rights towards them. However I noticed the reports are withheld and there's no way to export the report or mail the report. The link they provide simply redirects users to play store and which I believe is a waste of time and the user will be unable to access it over the web either. This app doesn't seem to value users privacy and the right to information. I personally wouldn't recommend this app to anyone, anywhere. P.S I have worked under healthcare domain and I do know the laws that abide by healthcare records and healthcare industry norms and this app doesn't seem to care to any of the norms or rules of EHR.",1,26-02-2021 02:46

The app only gives an option to reschedule the appointment but at that time there should also be an option to change the doctor as well.

Neither there is a proper tracking mechanism for booked tests in the app. At times even after 24 hours I do not get a call back losing valuable time just waiting. Also rather than reaching out personally over calls to fix the issue, its better to develop the app and system in such a way that there is no need of a middle person to call me and book tests on my behalf as an option\. while other apps like DoctorC, I can search, select and book(with online payment) my tests/services without any interference.

Mfine,A Google user,"The plans and consulting fee is higher than many other competing apps. It fails at a very important aspect. Once a user has taken the appointment, got prescription after paying the fee, theres max 3 day for follow up. Sometimes there are more days reqd before follow up. They just closes the case after 3 days. If any question arises, they demand money again. Please atleast let the user get what he's paid.

Mfine,A Google user,I got my thyroid profile done through this app and found my tsh to be 6.5 ( while their cut off is 5.5 ). But I got my tsh done just 6 months back and it was normal. And since I am a doctor myself I knew the report could be false. Hence for the benefit of doubt I got my tsh done after 20 days and it is tsh 2.9. I don't think they even understand the seriousness that is involved in doing such tests. So many patients and Doctors take decisions based on report. PLEASE GO TO A DIAGNOSTIC CENTRE,1,10-01-2020 16:27

The plus point us its medication nd tests fascility which they give you at your home. You didn't need to go a medical store and tests labs for testings.,5,25-11-2019 07:17

Mfine,A Google user,"So the people associated with this app organized a cardiac screening camp at my company Harman Connected Services in Pune. They made us download this app and register ourselves. After the screening was done (which included basic random blood sugar, 6 lead ECG and BMI) we were told that within 48 hours the ECG report will be uploaded against our respective profiles on the app. It has been more than 10 days since the screening was done and the report is not yet uploaded on the profile. Moreover, (and this is very very interesting) there are no doctors from Pune registered with this app despite the camp being conducted in Pune. I find it very amusing that educated people like us become fools at the hands of such fraudulent apps just for the sake of getting a free examination. I am not expecting any revert from the backend team of this app and even if i do, guys please refrain yourselves from saying that ""please contact our support team"". My review has everything that is needed by the support team to identify their fault and once can very well copy paste it and send to the support team on their own.",1,05-09-2019 13:24

Mfine,A Google user,"I'm really impressed with the way mfine is designed. It's simple yet effective. The best things that I noted: 1) The type/number of questions that are asked before actual consultation covers a lot in detail. 2) You are allowed to choose doctors whom you prefer. Details of doctors are mentioned. 3) Cost is reasonable, but it can be brought down a little. 4) You can schedule the consultation timing.( Although in my case there was a problem when I was trying to do so, hope they fix it).",5,22-03-2019 18:22

Mfine,A Google user,"This app is more of a time waste for now. They wasted my first promotional consultation stating that I need to go to nearest hospital for further advise for a very simple problem. It is long way for them but for now this app stands at 1 start. I will advise not to install and waste time unless you have nothing else to do at home. response to their reply dated 19/Dec is that: they should not waste the promotional consultation if they do not have a conclsive cure. dont mislead, bluff the customers",1,19-12-2018 10:17

Mfine,A Google user,how does a doctor join you.no emai id no contact given.no information about alternative medicine.do u include that or not.,5,28-12-2017 03:45
Mfine,A Google user,"At first, I was skeptical about the app, and my natural tendency was to try to meet a doc in person. The reality is, the whole experience with app changed my perspective. From the quick responses to having the doc revisit your case(online) with lab reports etc... is very convenient, useful and saves a lot of time. Plus you get to pick your doctor. This honestly is one very useful app. Thank you mfine team.",5,23-12-2017 09:03
